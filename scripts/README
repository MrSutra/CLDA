This contains a dump of the scripts used in our initial testing. These scripts are provided with minimal commentary, although please feel free to contact Chris Gropp at Clemson University with questions; eventually, a more robust version of this code with full documentation will be made available, but this has been postponed while experimenting with the basic structure of the code.
